    For tailored workshops, CSI staff use a problem-solving, collaborative
    process to identify the strengths and weakness of a staff member’s writing,
    editing, and communication production knowledge and skills.  Based on the
    findings, the CSI staff develops targeted, hands-on workshops and tutorials
    to improve the clients writing, editing and production skills. 

    CSI provides topic-based seminars to help your staff members improve their

    writing; popularizing science & technology;  professional, technical, &
    scientific writing; self-editing; targeting/tailoring communications;
