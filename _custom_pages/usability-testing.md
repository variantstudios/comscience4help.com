    By conducting usability testing of your websites, online media, and print
    publications, we will help you learn how your audiences use your
    communications, the problems they encounter, and how they try to solve
    problems they encounter. We then recommend how to improve your
    communications.

    CSI usability testing helps clients to identify and understand their
    audiences. Such information can then help clients improve print, electronic,
    digital, and electronic media and information and media campaigns. Print
    communications such as articles, magazines, newsletters, textbooks, how-to
    books, textbooks, tutorials, instructions, exhibits, displays, annual
    reports, and technical reports. Electronic digital and electronic media
    includes websites, Facebook, blogs, social media, visuals—charts, graphs,
    photographs, videos, tutorials, PowerPoint and presentations, and
    advertising. 

    Clients use diverse media provides in their strategic communications,
    information campaigns, marketing, advertising, and public relations, as well
    as internal and external client and customer relations.

    For card Sorting, CSI uses a multi-stage, group-interviewing process. We ask
    a sample of client’s audiences to organize and label key ideas for websites,
    software, manuals, and other communications.

    Research-based Expert/Heuristic Review: Combining research-based guidelines
    and our 25 years of professional communication expertise and usability
    testing experience, we critique your websites, online media, and print
    communications. 

    Protocol Analysis: Working with you, we identify your website (or other
    media) users and create a series of tasks your users might try when visiting
    your website. We then recruit a sample of your website’s users and ask them
    to talk aloud as they use your website. While they work, we observe and
    videotape them. Afterward, we interview them and ask them to complete a
    questionnaire about using your website.

    CSI staff work with their clients and suggest strategies to improve the
    effectiveness of your communications.

# Usability Testing

For more than 25 years, we have conducted usability testing of websites, software, instructions, training materials, and other media.
